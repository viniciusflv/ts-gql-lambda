# ts-gql-lambda

Getting started with GraphQL and TypeScript using TypeGraphQL - [https://pusher.com/tutorials/graphql-typescript](https://pusher.com/tutorials/graphql-typescript)

## Getting Started

Clone the project repository by running the command below if you use SSH

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:viniciusflv/ts-gql-lambda.git
```

If you use https, use this instead

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/viniciusflv/ts-gql-lambda.git
```

After cloning, to install the dependencies, run:

```bash
$ npm i
```

###Then you'll have two options

Start the serverless with:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Start the server with:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Which runs ``npm run buiild`` and ``npm run serve``

####Both cases the server will be running on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
